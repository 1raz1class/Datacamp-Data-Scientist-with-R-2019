# Identify variable types
# Recall from the video that the glimpse() function from dplyr provides a handy alternative to str() for previewing a dataset. In addition to the number of observations and variables, it shows the name and type of each column, along with a neatly printed preview of its values.

# Use the glimpse() function to view the variables in the email50 dataset.
