# Give your document a structure
# From now on, you're going to create a step-by-step RMarkdown report with your plot from the last chapter. The first thing you are going to do is to add structure through section headers.
# 
# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Turn the section titles of these paragraphs, e.g. "Summary", into headers by using the appropriate RMarkdown syntax.
# Use different header levels for sections and sub-sections. Start with second-level headers, so "Summary" shouldn't be a first-level header.
# "Summary", "Preparations" and "Analysis" should be second-level headers, while "Data", "Preprocessing" and "Results" should be third-level headers.
