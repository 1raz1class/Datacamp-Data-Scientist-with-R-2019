# Uniqueness of least squares regression line
# The least squares criterion implies that the slope of the regression line is unique. In practice, the slope is computed by R. In this exercise, you will experiment with trying to find the optimal value for the regression slope for weight as a function of height in the bdims dataset via trial-and-error.
# 
# To help, we've built a custom function for you called add_line(), which takes a single argument: the proposed slope coefficient.

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# The bdims dataset is available in your workspace. Experiment with different values (to the nearest integer) of the my_slope parameter until you find one that you think fits best.

# Estimate optimal value of my_slope
add_line(my_slope = 1)
